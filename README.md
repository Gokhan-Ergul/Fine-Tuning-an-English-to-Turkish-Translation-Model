# Fine-Tuning-an-English-to-Turkish-Translation-Model
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the process of fine-tuning the `Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-tc-big-en-tr` model for English-to-Turkish machine translation. The fine-tuning was performed on the `kde4` dataset, resulting in a significant improvement in translation quality, as measured by the BLEU score.
